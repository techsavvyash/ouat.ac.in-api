   "general_advisory": "Considering the above prediction, weather conditions in the next five days are likely to be favorable for sowing. Farmers should take advantage of this window to complete their sowing operation. Prevailing weather conditions favor the incidence of sucking pests. Necessary plant protection chemicals may be applied by mixing with stickers. In view of the forecast, farmers can resume agronomic practices and application of fertilizers in standing crops. This is the ideal time to transplant the seedlings of chilli, brinjal & early cauliflower in raised beds with proper drainage. Preventative spray of Carbendazim+Mancozeb @ 2g/l & Streptocyclin @1.5g/15lit of water should be applied to protect vegetable seedlings in cloudy weather. Protect the vegetable seedlings in nursery from rain by covering with plastic or polythene sheet over the nursery bed. Farmers are advised to add organic manure to the soil during land preparation as it enhances fertility and water holding capacity of the soil.",
