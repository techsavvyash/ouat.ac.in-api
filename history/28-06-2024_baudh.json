In view of thunderstorm accompanied with gusty winds, farmers should provide mechanical support to orchards, staking in vegetables and avoid grazing of animals during lightning. Farmers should start nursery bed preparation for kharif paddy and vegetable crops and also start planting new fruit crops in orchard by taking advantage of past rainfall condition. Prevailing weather condition is favorable for mealy bug attack in all types of crops so farmers should spray Thiamethoxam 25% WG @ 0.5-0.6g or Imidacloprid 17.8% SL @ 0.5ml or Lambda Cyhalothrin 4.9% CS per liter of water to control this insects but farmers should wait some days for any spraying operation because there is a chance of occurrence of rainfall in upcoming days.",
