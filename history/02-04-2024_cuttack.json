   "general_advisory": "In paddy crop, Panicle initiation, Panicle emergence, flowering and milking stages are the critical stages. Water deficit during these stages should be avoided. Cover the rows with dry leaves in Sugarcane. Apply sprinkler irrigation to bring down the heat effect. Conserve water by irrigating alternate rows. High temperature increases the water requirement of maize crop. Spread polythene in irrigation channels to save water wastage. Apply specific pesticides for tomato, brinjal, and other crops as mentioned. Consider different management practices for various crops.",
