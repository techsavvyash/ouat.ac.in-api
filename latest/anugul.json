   "general_advisory": "In assured irrigated areas select the land for wet bed nursery close to source of irrigation water with good drainage facilities. It is advisable to follow community nursery approach at village level. Divide nursery area into smaller plots of 1.5-metre-long, 10 cm height and convenient length. Irrigation channels of size 30 cm in width should be made along the beds for irrigation/drainage. Sprouted Seeds should be sown @ 40-50 g/m2 area of seed bed by line sowing with 5 cm gap between each line or direct broadcasting and put dried compost over seeds. Deworm them to reduce the load of internal parasites. Dipping should be done in case of sheep against external parasites. Keep animals indoor during rainy hours and provide clean and wholesome water.",
