Apply sprinkler irrigation for heat reduction. Irrigate maize crop properly. Spread polythene in irrigation channels. Watch for wilting in tomato and brinjal. Mulch coconut trees to reduce water loss. Cover vegetable seedlings with paper caps. Harvest fingerlings if water temperature rises in shallow ponds.",
