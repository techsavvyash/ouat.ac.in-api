Seeing the onset of monsoon events, prepare the nursery beds with raised bed method. Weed infestation may be seen by the light shower of rainfall, so ploughing with power-tiller or tractor to reduce weed infestation. Do not let the cattle roam around in the mid-day and during lightning. The light rainfall would not be enough for the seed bed preparation and subsequent transplanting, so preserve the rainwater accordingly. Cover the crop with leaf mulch to prevent weed growth and to conserve moisture.",
