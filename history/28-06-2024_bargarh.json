   "general_advisory": "As per Extended Range Forecast of IMD, rainfall is above normal and both maximum and minimum temperature is expected to be normal for Odisha state during 3rd July to 9th July, 2024. Farmers are advised to take necessary action towards kharif crop cultivation and avoid irrigation during that period. In view of thunderstorm accompanied with gusty winds, farmers should provide mechanical support to orchards, staking in vegetables, and avoid grazing of animals during lightning. Farmers should start nursery bed preparation for kharif paddy and vegetable crops and also start planting new fruit crops in orchard by taking advantage of past rainfall conditions. Prevailing weather condition is favorable for mealy bug attack in all types of crops so farmers should spray Thiamethoxam 25% WG @ 0.5-0.6g or Imidacloprid 17.8 % SL @ 0.5ml or Lambda Cyhalothrin 4.9 % CS per liter of water to control these insects but farmers should wait some days for any spraying operation because there is a chance of occurrence of rainfall in the upcoming days.",
