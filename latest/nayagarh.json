   "general_advisory": "In paddy crop, Panicle initiation, Panicle emergence, flowering and milking stages are the critical stages. Cover the rows with dry leaves in Sugarcane. Apply sprinkler irrigation to bring down the heat effect. Irrigate the maize crop properly. Spread polythene in irrigation channels to save water wastage. Apply Streptocyclin in tomato and brinjal. Mulch coconut leaves around the coconut tree to reduce water loss. Cover with paper caps on the newly planted vegetable seedlings during the daytime. Harvest fingerlings from shallow ponds if water temperature rises. For PADDY (Summer), manage Yellow Stem Borer and Blast Disease effectively. For BLACK GRAM & GREEN GRAM, manage Tobacco Caterpillar effectively. For SUGARCANE, manage Early Shoot Borer effectively. For BRINJAL, manage Brinjal shoot and fruit borer effectively. For OKRA, prevent whitefly infestation. For ONION, follow proper storage practices after harvesting. For MANGO, control mango hoppers effectively.",
