Cover the vegetable nursery with polythene to protect it from heavy rain and make drainage arrangement. In early planted maize and Jute apply nitrogen fertilizer after receding of rain. Make provisions for drainage where kharif maize or pulses etc. have been sown. If the Sugarcane crop is 4-5 months old, then wrapping and propping should be done for medium and long duration varieties to keep the canes erect.",
