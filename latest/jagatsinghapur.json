   "general_advisory": "In low land, go for transplanting of 21 days rice seedlings in the main field. Keep rain water in the main rice field by bunding for timely puddling and transplanting. Now bushing can be performed where rainfall was adequate. In heavy rainfall areas, stop the sowing of seeds and top dressing of fertilizers or herbicides for the time being. Nursery sowing should be completed by end of 2nd fortnight of July. If infestation of thrips is noticed in rice nursery, spray NSKE (Azadirachtin) @ 800 ml/acre or Lambda-Cyhalothrin 5% EC @ 100 ml/acre or Thiamethoxam 25 % WG @ 40g /acre. Make provisions for drainage, where maize or pulses etc. have been sown. Cover the vegetable nursery with polythene to protect it from heavy rain and make drainage arrangement.",
