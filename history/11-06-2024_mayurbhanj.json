Staking should be given in case of banana plants to avoid lodging. Protect the mango in trees by netting from thunderstorm and heavy wind. Cover the freshly prepared vegetable nursery with polythene or with straw to avoid high temperature. Sesbania (Dhaincha) seeds @ 10 kg/acre should be sown as Green Manuring crop after summer ploughing. Apply mulches to maintain high moisture status in the soil.",
