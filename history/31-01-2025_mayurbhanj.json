   "general_advisory": "Provide light irrigation to standing vegetables and crops during morning hours to prevent damage from fog, low temperature and moisture stress. Due to low night temperature and fog condition, there will be chance of infestation of sucking pests, leaf blight, powdery mildew in the Rabi crops and vegetable. Monitor the crops and vegetables, if symptoms are noticed, undertake appropriate plant protection measures. Carry out weeding, hoeing and other intercultural operations in Rabi vegetables. In Cole crops irrigation should be done at 7-8 Days interval depending upon soil moisture and weather condition. In winter during cold hours farmers should keep doors, windows and open spaces in cow sheds covered with polythene or gunny bag curtains to prevent direct contact to cold air. For maintaining the heat in the poultry shed during winter season, install heaters in the shed.",

Harvested plants should be kept in threshing floor for sun drying for 3-6 days depending on season. After that threshing should be done by beating the pods with stick. Clean harvested seeds should be dried under direct sunlight to bring the moisture content below 10- 12% for safe storage. Dal processing should be done in composite mini dal mill. To avoid storage pestsâ€™ infestation during storage smearing of seeds should be done with edible oil @ 250 ml/ Quintal of seeds. Dried leaves of either Begonia or Neem @ 1 kg/Bag should be kept inside the storage bag to minimize storage pest load.
