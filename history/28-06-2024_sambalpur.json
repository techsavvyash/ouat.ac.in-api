Farmers should start nursery bed preparation for kharif paddy and vegetable crops and also start planting new fruit crops in orchard by taking the advantage of past rainfall condition.\nPrevailing weather condition is favorable for mealy bug attack in all types of crops so farmers should spray Thiamethoxam 25% WG @ 0.5-0.6g or Imidacloprid 17.8 % SL @ 0.5ml or Lambda Cyhalothrin 4.9 % CS per liter of water to control these insects but farmers should wait some days for any spraying operation because there is a chance of occurrence of rainfall in upcoming days.",
