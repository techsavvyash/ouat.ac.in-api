   "general_advisory": "For one-acre area of paddy transplanting 400 m2 (10 Decimal) size of land is required for nursery raising. Before sowing, paddy seeds should be treated with Trichoderma powder formulation@10g/kg of seeds or any other seed treating chemicals like Thiram 75% @ 3 gm or Captan 50% @ 3 gm per kg of seeds procured from the Government approved agencies. Go for non-paddy crops in the upland to avoid terminal drought. Intercropping of cereals+pulses/oilseeds is recommended. Go for early sowing/transplanting as for as possible to complete these by mid-August. Go for medium duration rice varieties in medium land. Go for line sowing of rice followed by early beaushaning and weeding. This will avoid the rainfall required for transplanting, and over -aged seedlings if transplanted late.",
