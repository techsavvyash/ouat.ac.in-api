   "general_advisory": "In low land, go for transplanting of 21 days rice seedlings in the main field. Keep rainwater in the main rice field by bunding for timely puddling and transplanting. Bushaning can be performed where rainfall was adequate. Nursery sowing should be completed by the end of 2nd fortnight of July. Make provisions for drainage where maize or pulses have been sown. Cover the vegetable nursery with polythene to protect it from heavy rain and make drainage arrangements.",

            "For sandy soil apply 35 kg DAP, 15 kg Potash and 8 kg Urea per acre during last puddling. Transplanting of 20-25 days old seedlings should be done at a spacing of 20x15 cm, plant 2-3 seedlings per hill for high yielding varieties. Use pre-emergence herbicide Pretilachlor @ 800 ml/acre or Oxadiargyl 80%W. P @ 30gm/acre or Pyrazosulfuron Ethyl 10% W.P @ 80gm/acre at 1-3 DAT. Spray the herbicide by mixing it in 200 litres of water per acre or Mix the herbicide with 20 kg of sand and broadcast it uniformly. Always use flat-fan or flood-jet nozzle and clean water for herbicide spraying."
