   "general_advisory": "Good quality seed reduces the necessary seed rate, provides healthy and strong seedlings, gives a uniform crop stand in the field, and results in higher yields. Good quality seed is clean (contains no stones, soil particles, weed seed), pure (contains only grains from one variety), and healthy (full big grains, same colour , no cracks). If you are using the own harvested seeds, then dissolve 1 kg salt in 10 litres of water for 10 kg of seed. Dip 2-3 kg of the seed at a time in the solution and reject the floating chaffy and weed seeds. Collect heavy seeds settled at bottom of the solution and wash them 2-3 times by clean water . Dry the seeds in direct sunlight for 2-3 days before treating them with fungicides.",
