   "general_advisory": "For paddy cultivation, always use certified seeds. Germination test is advisable before sowing. Use 24-30 kg of paddy seeds/acre for broadcasting and 12-16 kg seeds/acre for sowing by seed drill depending on the test weight of the seed. Incorporate the dhaincha green manuring crop at the time of initial puddling of the main field. Apply full dose of Phosphorus and Potash as basal dose. Arhar can be grown as an intercrop in groundnut for more profit. In okra, treat the seed with imidacloprid for pest resistance. Before sowing paddy seeds, treat them with Trichoderma powder or other seed treating chemicals. Farmers are advised to sow in sufficient soil moisture. Sow paddy seeds in line or behind the country plough at specific spacing and depth.",
