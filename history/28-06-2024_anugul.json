It is advisable to follow community nursery approach at village level. Divide nursery area into smaller plots of 1.5-metre-long, 10 cm height and convenient length. Irrigation channels of size 30 cm in width should be made along the beds for irrigation/drainage. Sprouted Seeds should be sown @ 40-50 g/m2 area of seed bed by line sowing with 5 cm gap between each line or direct broadcasting and put dried compost over seeds."

Farmers can spray ectoparasiticides like cypermethrin or deltamethrin 2-4% on animalsâ€™ body and also in the shed. If fever, shivering, brown coloured urine, off feed etc. are noticed, consult veterinary doctor immediately. Apply lime in and around shed which causes disinfection and keep floor dry. Make silage from surplus green fodder for easy storage and use during the lean period."

The compound feed in the house should be placed on the platform above the ground to prevent the feed from regaining moisture. Regular checking of feeders to avoid fungus contamination. Provide your birds with warm water periodically during this rainy season to encourage consumption and help them keep warm without using up energy reserved in the process. Supplementary feeding should be given to the scavenging birds in backyard."
