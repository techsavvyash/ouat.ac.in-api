   "general_advisory": "In view of light rainfall, the sowing of seeds and top dressing of fertilizers or herbicides may be deferred for the time being. Before sowing, paddy seeds should be treated with Trichoderma powder formulation@10g/kg of seeds or any other seed treating chemicals like Thiram 75% @ 3 gm or Captan 50% @ 3 gm per kg of seeds. Sow the paddy seeds in line preferably with seed drill or three tyne cultivator-cum-seed drill or behind the country plough at 15 x 15 cm or 20 x10 cm spacing. Seed should be placed at a depth of 4-6 cm. Use 24-30 kg of paddy seeds/acre for broadcasting and 12- 16 kg seeds/acre for sowing by seed drill depending on the test weight of the seed. For one-acre area of paddy transplanting 400 m2 (10 Decimal) size of land is required for nursery raising. Apply full dose of Phosphorus and Potash @ 12kg each /acre (preferably 75 kg SSP or 27 kg DAP + 20 kg MOP) as band placement behind the plough or by fertilizer cum seed drill in upland rice as basal dose. Arhar can be grown as an intercrop in groundnut at 6:2 row ratio (Groundnut: Arhar) for more profit and soil health management. ",

It is advisable to follow community nursery approach at village level. Divide nursery area into smaller plots of 1.5-metre-long, 10 cm height and convenient length. Irrigation channels of size 30 cm in width should be made along the beds for irrigation/drainage. Sprouted Seeds should be sown @ 40-50 g/ m2 area of seed bed by line sowing with 5 cm gap between each line or direct broadcasting and put dried compost over seeds Apply light irrigations to the nursery area particularly in the evening so that the field remains wet and do not keep standing water.

Apply well powdered Gypsum @ 100 kg/acre and incorporate into the soil along with the basal fertilizers, this will improve number of pods and pod filling. Mix the fertilizer with the soil so that seeds do not come in direct contact with the fertilizer.

Generally, a density of 5,000 fingerlings/ha is kept as a standard stocking. Groundnut oil cake and rice bran is given in same ratio @ 5% of the total biomass of stocking material. Cow dung, urea and super phosphate should be applied to increase pond quality. In 8-10 months, fishes attain their marketable size. "
