Apply sprinkler irrigation to reduce heat effect. High temperature increases maize crop's water requirement. Spread polythene in irrigation channels. Apply Streptocyclin in tomato and brinjal. Mulch coconut leaves to reduce water loss. Cover newly planted vegetable seedlings during the day. Harvest fingerlings in shallow ponds when water temperature rises.",
